Trying to deploy the code on the laptop.

We noticed under totesmagoats -> Properties -> Java Build Path -> Libraries Tab that "wpilib.sources" was associated with the absolute path to a JAR file (wpilib.jar) on the main coding system but with NOTHING on the laptop.

Conclusion: wpilib was missing, meaning that the FRC tools have not been loaded on the laptop.

The procedure to fix this is documentat at the following location: 
https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485/m/13809/l/145002-installing-eclipse-c-java.  In particular, see the "Installing the development plugins - Option 1: Online Install" section.

** Note 2: Problem was not fixed by this deployment (and restarting Eclipse, and waiting for "Installing Java" to complete.

Noticed a discrepancy between "Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Build Path -> Classpath Variables" on the two systems.  On the desktop, these four variables are defined:

	networktables: C:/Users/pltwe5/wpilib/java/current/lib/NetworkTables.jar
	networktables.sources: C:/Users/pltwe5/wpilib/java/current/lib/NetworkTables-sources.jar
	wpilib: C:/Users/pltwe5/wpilib/java/current/lib/WPILib.jar
	wpilib.sources: C:/Users/pltwe5/wpilib/java/current/lib/WPILib-sources.jar

Looking into whether our Java installation is complete.

** Note 3: If you go to Help -> Installation Details -> [Installed Software tab], you can see that the desktop machine has four plugins installed:

(1) Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers 4.4.1.20140925-1820
(2) Eclipse Java Development Tools 3.10.0.v20140925-0400
(3) Robot C++ Development 0.1.0.201501221609
(4) Robot Java Development 0.1.0.201501221609

The laptop has the same.

The laptop also seems to have the same WPI plugins.

** Note 4: Copying the claspath variables eliminated 3 of 4 build errors.  Remaining error is about the missing target "deploy."
